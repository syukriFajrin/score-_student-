# Build Linear Regression Model
---
## Overview
---
This project aims to predict students' scores based on their study hours using a Simple Linear Regression model.

---
## Objectives
---
* Perform data scaling  
* Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
* Build a Linear Regression model  
* Provide insights based on the results  

---
## Dataset
---
The dataset contains 1 feature and 1 target variable:
* hour_study (feature)  
* score_student (target)  

---
## Structure Folder
---
```bash
SCORE_STUDENT
│
├── scratch
├── main.ipynb
├── student_scores.csv 
└── README.md
```

---
## Tech Stack
---
* Python  
* Pandas  
* NumPy  
* Matplotlib  
* Scratch implementation (manual modeling)

---
## Workflow
---
* Data Cleaning  
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
* Build Model  
* Test Model  
* Conclusion
